Test Driven Development, also known as TDD, is a software development approach in which tests are written before the actual code implementation. The process follows a cycle of repeating short development iterations, each of which begins with the writing of a test case. TDD consists of the following basic steps:

Write a Test: Developers start by writing a test case that defines a new function or improvement of an existing function. The test should fail initially because the code being tested has not been written yet.

Run the Test: The next step is to run all the tests, including the new one. At this point, the new test should fail, as there is no code to make it pass.

Write Code: Developers then write the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test. The focus is on making the test case pass and not on writing comprehensive or optimized code at this stage.

Run Tests: After writing the code, developers rerun all the tests. If any test fails, they make the necessary adjustments to the code to fix the issue.

Refactor Code (Optional): Once the tests pass, developers may refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, or efficiency. The key is to ensure that the refactoring does not break any existing functionality, and the tests continue to pass.

Repeat: The cycle is then repeated. Developers write additional tests for new features or improvements, run the tests (which should fail initially), write the code to make the tests pass, run the tests again, and refactor if necessary.

TDD promotes a more robust and reliable codebase by ensuring that changes to the code are validated against a suite of tests. It also encourages a modular and testable design, as code is written with testing in mind from the beginning. TDD is widely used in agile development methodologies and has proven to be an effective practice for producing high-quality software.
